Dear Nick,

Thank you again for meeting with me on Friday.

Based on our discussion here are few things that could help us clean out noise in mouse IMPACT calls: 

Filter out non-IMPACT genes
Filter out mutations that are present in pooled normal (eg: SPOP)
The copy numbers pattern of JUN amplification  (highly focal in our dataset), it's usually not hyper focal in other datasets - possibly noise
The copy number data for gene cdkn2b (potentially not deleted as tumor and normal have this deletion)
Could we map mouse to human co-ordinates (mm10 to hg19) to compare functional relevance, although mouse and human co-ordinates don't always line up.
For a mutation that occurs in ever sample - is there a better way to filter these out (more stringent criteria's)
I have attached screenshots of few examples that we went over during our meeting as well.

Thank you again so much.
